# Day 1 (7/6/22) Reflection

I was able to finish all of the questions in the google colab with little issue - I already knew python and had some experience with numpy (but needed some quick refreshing). I was unable to make it to the reflection corner due to connection issues, as I was travelling (I have already notified my mentor of this). Despite this, I will do my best to keep on top of my work.
