# Day 4 (7/12/22) Reflection

Today I learned about the basics of neural network building. Since I have some background knowledge of neural networks, I didn't have too much trouble with the ideas, concepts, or steps introduced today. My main confusions with today's work stemmed from  the more specific research questions (most notably questions 4 & 5), however, I feel that I now have a decent understanding of the answers to those questions.
