# Day 6 (7/14/22) Reflection

Today I learned about convolutional neural networks & their method of feature extraction through convolutions & max-pooling. I already had some background knowledge of convolutional neural networks (having previously looked into them for image classification), so today's work wasn't too dificult, and it was interesting going into more details about this topic.
