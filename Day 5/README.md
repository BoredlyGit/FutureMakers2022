# Day 5 (7/13/22) Reflection

Today was the most difficult, but intersting day. Learning about the inner workings of neural networks and the underlying math was especialy intersting, and required some extra research. However, I feel that I now have a good understanding of the processes behind neural networks (although my understanding of derivatives is a bit shaky).
