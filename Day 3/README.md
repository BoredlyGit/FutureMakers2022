# Day 3 (7/8/22) Reflection
I found today's work and concepts to be a bit more confusing than the materials from previous days, as today we started working with neural networks and tensorflow. While I had some background knowledge of neural networks, I did need some refreshing on some details, and watched these videos on [backpropagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) and [gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w). I understood the material well and was able to do the questions without much trouble. The only issue I encountered was with question 6, as changing the final sigmoid to a softmax resulted in the model only outputting 1. I later found that this was because the elements of vector output of the softmax function must sum to 1, and this model has only 1 output.
